## What am I Knowledgable About that I can Preach On?

### #1

Well, since I am a wildlife bio major, I can basically preach on facts and terms related to Wildlife Biology. I can answer questions about what a specific habitat for a specific species is, what the diets of most of the mammals in Missouri are, and why certain animals behave the way they do. Nature has been my life since I was 5 years old. That's most of my life. It is my world, and I have learned everything I could about it, including the past 3 years. Genetic diversity, niches, recruitment rates, handling time, Lotka-Volterra model, predator/prey relationships in a closed population, the freaking Isle Royale moose/wolf experiment (fascinating stuff), geography, the Red List, etc, etc.

I am a coffee nerd. I am a former barista, so I had to take a coffee class every six months to reinforce the knowledge I had and learn new tricks of the trade. Because of said class, I know more about coffee than the average Joe (ha!). There's a lot that goes into coffee, such as roasting techniques, where the beans come from, what kind of bean it is, and the geography of the area that bean came from has an impact on the flavor. Coffee is a fruit - it's a cherry. Coffee comes in two basic forms - Robusta and Arabica. Arabica is SO much better. Robusta is what Folgers is. Arabica is what you get from coffee shops.

Storm Chasing. I have done this for almost...10 years with my dad. He got me started, and I've had to take storm spotter classes to keep up with everything, but I know all the lingo and what to look for when it comes to spotting and chasing these wonders of nature down. They are beautifully distructive, and there's a lot of science that is behind them. If I had to, I could talk about storm chasing/spotting techniques all day! It is a dangerous hobby. Because I've been doing this for 10 years, it has become something that is almost second nature. Radar is my best friend, and I can call out rotation on the screen before I ever see it in the sky. Wall clouds, scud clouds, in flow, down drafts, microbursts, debris ball, radar indicated hail, radar indicated rotation, radar indicated tornado, radar indicated debris ball. The list goes on and on. I've been told by A LOT of people that I should go into meteorology because I love it so much, but that requires a chemistry major at this school, and I HATE chemistry. It would be so much fun, but it's not a reality right now.
