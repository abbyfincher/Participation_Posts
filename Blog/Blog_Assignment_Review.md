#### One Thing I Learned

Scientific writing for a blog does not have to be strictly methodical. It can be narrative, persuasive, informative, or a mix of the three. I already knew how to use Wordpress because of my personal blog, so I wish I could say that I learned how to use it, but that is not the case. I always learn something new on Wordpress, though. Customizing my site is always fun. Playing around with different themes and layouts lets you see different aesthetics. 

Speaking of aesthetics, if a blog is not pleasing to the eye, people most likely will not read it. I can say I've done the same thing multiple times. A topic looks interesting, the site is boring, I don't even read the article. Whether or not I'll keep up with this blog is up in the air. To be or not to be...

### One Thing Still Unclear

Still not 100% certain exactly what you what you wanted for this assignment. I know it was personal preferance on topic (again, thank you for that), but this was a huge assignment in a short amount of time and some of us are fuzzy on exactly what you were looking for - despite the outline in the class repo. Also, some of us will never use a blog format for our job. I'm a biologist. Will I ever use a blog as means of communicating data to the rest of the non-scientific world? Meh. Maybe since I already enjoy blogging, but...it's just not a normal thing for wildlife biologists to do. We'll see. 

### Additional Comments

The assignment was fun, but it was also a huge load in a short amount of time for many of us. Class schedules are crazy, and finding time to sit, outline, and type out a blog post was something I found myself struggling to incorporate in this busy life called CofO. I wish we had more time to do this and focus more and actually feel like I did well on it, because I'm rather iffy on how this actually went.
