##  What are your writing habits? - how you think about it, when you get the work done, what you use to get the word done, etc. 

- Writing habits, as of now, are procrastination until the very last possible stress point - usually a couple days before. Usually there are things that are of more importance than a paper unless it is a big term paper that needs to be revised and revised again to make it the best possible outcome. Research papers receive a little more attention than most other papers. I do keep really good track of my resources because I can't lose them. 
- I like writing, but only on things I want to write and something I find interesting, so this class hasn't been bad in that regard. Some of my science classes have been a #strugglebus because I've been forced to write about something I just don't care about, so it gets shoved to the back burner until I find the motivation (usually time crunch) to do it. 
- When I write, it's usually after dinner, but only 1-2 hours after I finally get back to my dorm room. Then I have to figure out a place to go to actually write, because, let's be honest, nothing gets done when I'm in my room because that's where I go to chillax. So...I'm usually writing for 5 hours at a time into the wee hours of the mornin'. 

## How might those habits improve?

-Well...Travel past the procrastination station, and things might actually get done without the stress of a bunny being hunted by a coyote in the middle of winter. Finding motivation, though, is the hard part, especially when it's #senioryear and there's hardly any left. If I put forth the effort in all my papers like I do big research papers, things might go better. Maybe taking the time to write earlier in the day so I'm not staying up till all hours of the morning...It may just help my sleep habits, I don't know. 

## One Strength

- Write now, go back and edit later. Usually letting myself to write freely so I don't get bogged down with a strict idea and pure data then going back to make changes by adding things or deleting things. The stress level is less and I don't get as frustrated.
